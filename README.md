# Digital-Hardware-Design-Project
//This project focuses on the image processing chain of an autonomous driving Segway, a two-colored pattern in input images needs to be recognized by extracting similar prominent areas, the so-called Regions, which is based on Region Growing Algorithm. Multiple pipelines are implemented to accelerate the processing.

//The functions are inplemented with VHDL on Xilinx Zynq Zedboard

// zip file /feature_extraction/ contains all VHDL codes of subcomponents and the final wapper of the system  
// pdf file /Description/ provides a detailed description about the Project content
